# liverScores

A small collection of functions for the automated calculation of clinical liver scores

No responsibility or liability can be taken for the correctness of scores calculation - these functions are made publicly available for research only!

Score outputs have been corroborated with clinicians at King's College Hospital, using the references contained within each function where used.
